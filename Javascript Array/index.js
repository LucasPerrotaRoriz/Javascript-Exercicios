let people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];

Using a loop, iterate through this array and console.log all of the people.
Write the command to remove "Greg" from the array.
Write the command to remove "James" from the array.
Write the command to add "Matt" to the front of the array.
Write the command to add your name to the end of the array.
Using a loop, iterate through this array and after console.log-ing "Mary", exit from the loop.
Write the command to make a copy of the array using slice. The copy should NOT include "Mary" or "Matt".
Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Mary" is located.
Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Foo" is located (this should return -1).
Redefine the people variable with the value you started with. Using the splice command, remove "Devon" from the array and add "Elizabeth" and "Artie". Your array should look like this when you are done ["Greg", "Mary", "Elizabeth", "Artie", "James"].
Create a new variable called withBob and set it equal to the people array concatenated with the string of "Bob".

/*
1. Shuffle the array
Imagine the supplied array is like a pack of cards. Write a function to shuffle this array in to a
completely new and entirely random order, much like shuffling a pack of cards.
*/

/*
2. Evenly mix two arrays
Write a function that receives two arrays, then mix the two arrays evenly –starting with the first
item of the first array. The returned array should alternate between each array in turn, one element
at a time. So the sequence would look like:

Array 1 first element, Array 2 first element, Array 1 second element, Array 2 second element… and so
on.

The elements that make up the arrays are completely random, and the arrays can be of differing
lengths.
 */

/*
3. Order the arrays by sum, ascending or descending
Given an array of arrays (ie. a multidimensional array), each containing only numeric values,
order these arrays by the sum of the elements within.
*/


/*
4. Find the odd one out
Find the odd one out in the provided array. All array elements are equal, except one.
Your function must return this odd one out.
*/

/*
5. Find the smallest and largest numbers
Deduce the smallest and the largest number from the supplied numeric array.
Return an array containing these numbers, smallest number first.
*/

/*
6. Split the numeric array by odd/even
Write a function to separate a single array in to two separate arrays.
The supplied array will only contain numeric values. Your function should output two arrays:
one containing odd numbers, the other containing even numbers.

The returned arrays should be ordered appropriately, with distinct values only (no duplicates).
The even array should be returned first.
*/

/*
7. Return only unique values
In this JavaScript array exercise, the supplied array may contain duplicate values. Write a function to return only unique values —
values that only occur exactly one time within the provided array.
*/

/*
8. Spell out the alphabet
The supplied array is a multidimensional array composed entirely of letters, broken down into sets
of 3. The letters within each set of 3 are in random order; and the overall array pieces are in
random order, also.

The array is composed in such a way that it can be sorted in to an alphabetic order. Your function
should reorder all of these pieces to accomplish this.
*/

/*
9. Find the common words
Your function must accept 2 arrays, then return the common words from each. So, a new array
containing the words which occur at least once in each of the supplied arrays must be returned back.

Words that are most common throughout both of the arrays should be returned first.
*/

/*
10. Does the array contain all of the elements?
Write a function to accept two arrays. Does the first array contain all elements represented in the
second array?
*/

/*
11. Shift all numeric values to the beginning
   ~~~~~~ ~ ~ =´´~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=´~The supplied array will contain both numeric and non-numeric characters.

Return a new array where all numeric values are positioned at the beginning of the array, in ascending order.
The non-numeric values must come after these, also ordered appropriately.
*/

/*
12. Move the element
Given an array and two indexes, move the relevant element within the array to its new position.
*/

/*
13. Build a new array by indexes
From the first array, construct a new array based on the indexes supplied.
*/

/*
Exercise-2 with Solution
Write a JavaScript function to clone an array.
*/

/*
Exercise-5 with Solution
Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into
a string.
Expected Output :
"Red,Green,White,Black"
"Red,Green,White,Black"
"Red+Green+White+Black
*/

/*
Exercise-7 with Solution
Write a JavaScript program to sort the items of an array.
Sample array : var arr1 = [ 3, 8, 7, 6, 5, -4, 3, 2, 1 ];
Sample Output : -4,-3,1,2,3,5,6,7,8
